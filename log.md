# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Setup, installed Windows 10 VM and Visual Studio within, Visual Studio for MACOS sucks. Setup a clone of my webserver at www.snowdon.me part of this challenge will be learning VB.net for school and part of it will be learning WebDev further from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getting a shared drive accessable on the VM LAMP box so I can write direct to /var/www/html Parallels disk not loading or summat.
