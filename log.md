# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** None to speak of, spent the hour making sure my lessons for tomorrow were up to date, hopefully will get to do some coding during my planning preparation and assessment periods today in school as I've spend my own hour of code time doing that instead of coding. Need to speak to the boss about flexibilty on .net.
**Thoughts:** I hate VB as it's not cross platform compatible.

### Day 6: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** COmbination of copied and created code playing with procedures and functions.
**Thoughts:** It takes ages (six minutes and 26 seconds) to boot up visual studio via a virtual machine, I need to get more RAM 8Gb isn't cutting the mustard.

### Day 5: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This hour was spent finally getting my webdev virtual environment setup so I can test code before going live on my webserver with it.
I've made a shared folder from paralells to the ubuntu vm has to run ubuntu 14 for my version of parallels toolbox to run, then installed apache2, then deleted /var/www/html, then created a symbolic link to the shared folder in /var/www called html then installed mysql and then upgraded the ubuntu box to v18 and then install php etc, which doesn't seem to be working but I've got to get to work, so that'll have to wait until tomorrow's hour.

**Thoughts:** Will complete the other VB objectives and post over the next few days.

### Day 3: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Running Visual Studio in a windoze VM, creating reading and appending txt files from VB.

**Thoughts:** Took way longer than I wanted with this, well over an hour but I have the makings of a lesson now from it.

### Day 2: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: IDE's for Visual Basic suck unless you are a Windoze user.

**Thoughts:** My Boss insists we use visual basic (gods know why there's tonnes of python programming resources out there and or even C# is more cross platform compatible) with the kids, the problem is that M$ are progressively reducing cross platform support for vb in favor of c#, it seems to me. Their visualstudiocode IDE doesn't support vb at all... (does it? maybe I'll try it.)

### Day 1: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: none really.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with trying to get Parallels toolbox installed on the LAMP VM devbox to even start this challenge. Doesn't feel like any progress has been made, may abandon the devbox in favour of just doing the freeCodeCamp challenges.

### Day 0: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setup, installed Windows 10 VM and Visual Studio within, Visual Studio for MACOS sucks. Setup a clone of my webserver at www.snowdon.me part of this challenge will be learning VB.net for school and part of it will be learning WebDev further from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getting a shared drive accessable on the VM LAMP box so I can write direct to /var/www/html Parallels disk not loading or summat.
