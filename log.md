# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setup, installed Windows 10 VM and Visual Studio within, Visual Studio for MACOS sucks. Setup a clone of my webserver at www.snowdon.me part of this challenge will be learning VB.net for school and part of it will be learning WebDev further from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getting a shared drive accessable on the VM LAMP box so I can write direct to /var/www/html Parallels disk not loading or summat.

### Day 1: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: none really.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling with trying to get Parallels toolbox installed on the LAMP VM devbox to even start this challenge. Doesn't feel like any progress has been made, may abandon the devbox in favour of just doing the freeCodeCamp challenges.

### Day 2: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: IDE's for Visual Basic suck unless you are a Windoze user.

**Thoughts:** My Boss insists we use visual basic (gods know why there's tonnes of python programming resources out there and or even C# is more cross platform compatible) with the kids, the problem is that M$ are progressively reducing cross platform support for vb in favor of c#, it seems to me. Their visualstudiocode IDE doesn't support vb at all... (does it? maybe I'll try it.)
